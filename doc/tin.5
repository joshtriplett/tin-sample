.SH DESCRIPTION
This manpage describes the various (config) files and their formats used by
the
.BR \%tin (1)
newsreader. All files are expected to have unix style ('\\n' aka LF) line
endings.

.BR \%mailcap (5)
files as defined in \fBRFC\%1524\fP. The mailcap files are read by
.BR \%tin (1)
to determine how to display non-text messages at the local site. Any line
that starts with "#" is a comment. Blank lines are ignored. Otherwise, each
line defines a single mailcap entry for a single content type. Long lines
may be continued by ending them with a backslash character, "\\".
.sp
Each individual mailcap entry consists of a content-type specification, a
command to execute, and (possibly) a set of optional "flag" values.
.sp
The "type" field is simply any legal content type name. It is the string
that will be matched against the ''Content\-Type:'' header to decide if this
is the mailcap entry that matches the current message. Additionally, the
type field may specify a subtype or a wildcard to match all subtypes.
.sp
The "command" field is any UNIX command and is used to specify the
interpreter for the given type of message. It will be passed to the shell
via the
.BR \%system (3)
facility.
.sp
Semicolons and backslashes within the command or any flag field must be
quoted with backslashes. If the field contains "%s", those two characters
will be replaced by the name of a file that contains the body of the
message. If it contains "%t", those two characters will be replaced by the
content-type field, including the subtype, if any. If it contains "%{"
followed by a parameter name and a closing "}", then all those characters
will be replaced by the value of the named parameter, if any, from the
\&''Content\-Type:'' header. Finally, if the field contains "\\%", those two
characters will be replaced by a single "%" character.
.\"
.\" Two special codes can appear in the viewing command for objects of type
.\" multipart (any subtype). These are "%n" and "%F". %n will be replaced by
.\" the number of parts within the multipart object. %F will be replaced by a
.\" series of arguments, two for each part, giving first the content-type and
.\" then the name of the temporary file where the decoded part has been stored.
.\"
.sp
Besides the type and command field the following "flags" are defined:
.TP
.B compose
The "compose" field may be used to specify a program that can be used to
compose a new body or body part in the given format. Its intended use is to
support mail composing agents that support the composition of multiple types
of mail using external composing agents. As with the view-command, the
semantics of program execution are operating system dependent. The result of
the composing program may be data that is not yet suitable for mail
transport - that is, a Content\-Transfer\-Encoding may need to be applied to
the data.
.TP
.B composetyped
The "composetyped" field is similar to the "compose" field, but is to be
used when the composing program needs to specify the ''Content\-Type:''
header field to be applied to the composed data. The "compose" field is
simpler, and is preferred for use with existing (non-mail-oriented) programs
for composing data in a given format. The "composetyped" field is necessary
when the Content\-Type information must include auxiliary parameters, and
the composition program must then know enough about mail formats to produce
output that includes the mail type information.
.TP
.B edit
The "edit" field may be used to specify a program that can be used to edit a
body or body part in the given format. In many cases, it may be identical
in content to the "compose" field, and shares the operating-system dependent
semantics for program execution.
.TP
.B print
The "print" field may be used to specify a program that can be used to print
a message or body part in the given format. As with the view-command, the
semantics of program execution are operating system dependent.
.TP
.B test
The "test" field may be used to test some external condition (e.g., the
machine architecture, or the window system in use) to determine whether or
not the mailcap line applies. It specifies a program to be run to test some
condition. The semantics of execution and of the value returned by the test
program are operating system dependent. If the test fails, a subsequent
mailcap entry should be sought. Multiple test fields are not permitted -
since a test can call a program, it can already be arbitrarily complex.
.TP
.B needsterminal
The "needsterminal" field indicates that the view-command must be run on an
interactive terminal. This is needed to inform window-oriented user agents
that an interactive terminal is needed. (The decision is not left
exclusively to the view-command because in some circumstances it may not be
possible for such programs to tell whether or not they are on interactive
terminals.) The needsterminal command should be assumed to apply to the
compose and edit commands, too, if they exist. Note that this is NOT a test
- it is a requirement for the environment in which the program will be
executed, and should typically cause the creation of a terminal window when
not executed on either a real terminal or a terminal window.
.TP
.B copiousoutput
The "copiousoutput" field indicates that the output from the view-command
will be an extended stream of output, and is to be interpreted as advice to
the UA (User Agent mail-reading program) that the output should be either
paged or made scroll-able. Note that it is probably a mistake if
needsterminal and copiousoutput are both specified.
.TP
.B description
The "description" field simply provides a textual description, optionally
quoted, that describes the type of data, to be used optionally by mail
readers that wish to describe the data before offering to display it.
.TP
.B textualnewlines
The "textualnewlines" field, if set to any non-zero value, indicates that
this type of data is line-oriented and that, if encoded in base64, all
newlines should be converted to canonical form (CRLF) before encoding, and
will be in that form after decoding. In general, this field is needed only
if there is line-oriented data of some type other than text/* or non-line-
oriented data that is a subtype of text.
.TP
.B x11\-bitmap
The "x11\-bitmap" field names a file, in X11 bitmap (xbm) format, which
points to an appropriate icon to be used to visually denote the presence of
this kind of data.
.TP
.B nametemplate
The "nametemplate" field gives a file name format, in which %s will be
replaced by a short unique string to give the name of the temporary file to
be passed to the viewing command. This is only expected to be relevant in
environments where filename extensions are meaningful, e.g., one could
specify that a GIF file being passed to a gif viewer should have a name
ending in ".gif" by using "nametemplate=%s.gif"
.PP
.BR \%tin (1)
currently only respects the "test", "description", "nametemplate" and partly
the "needsterminal" flags, all other flags are internally ignored. It also
can't handle the "%F" and "%n" expansions yet.

.RS
The group attributes files may be used to override some global settings from
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc\fR on a per group basis. Order is
important as last match counts; this allows one to refine attributes for
narrowed scopes. Note that the \fIscope=<grouplist>\fR line has to be
specified before the attributes are specified for that list and each
attribute can only be set once per scope section. All attributes are set to
a reasonable default so you only have to specify the attribute that you want
to change. All toggle attributes are set by specifying ON/OFF. Otherwise,
they function exactly as their global equivalents. The following group
attributes are available:
.TP

This changes the list of groups to which the attributes that follow will be
applied. See the section NEWSGROUP LISTS & WILDCARDS in

.TP
.B mark_saved_read

.TP
.B mime_forward
Determines whether usenet articles are forwarded as attachment or
inline. When set to OFF, the forwarded article will be included in
the body of the mail, while setting this variable to ON will cause
the article to be attached as a separate MIME part. Enabling
\fBmime_forward\fP is particularly useful for articles consisting of
multiple MIME parts such as PGP/MIME signed messages or being encoded
in a different character set than your local one. It is also useful
if the receiver should be able to operate on the entire forwarded
article (i.e., view or save it without your comments). On the other
hand, if you want to forward only some parts of the article or to
insert 'inline' annotations, you might want to disable this option.
Currently mime_forward is forced if the article to be attached is a
multipart MIME article, this may change in a future version.
Please note that for this option to have effect, the tinrc variable
\fBinteractive_mailer\fP has to be set to 0 (which is the default).
.TP
.B mime_types_to_save
A comma separated list of MIME major/minor Content\-Types that will be
saved when using the view/save and save/autosave features.
A single * can be used to wildcard the major and/or minor type and
a ! as the first character in an entry will negate it, eg:
image/*,!image/bmp,!text/html. Default is */*

overrides the setting (if any) of organization in
\fI/etc/tin/tin.defaults\fR and $\fBORGANIZATION\fP (or $\fBNEWSORG\fP on
Apollo DomainOS). Note that some newsserver might still overwrite the

.RS +1i
.IP 0 3
\fBKill only unread arts\fP is the 'traditional' behavior of
.BR \%tin (1).
Only unread articles are killed once only by marking them read. As
filtering only happens on unread articles with \fBkill_level\fP set
to 0, \fBart_marked_killed\fP and \fBart_marked_read_selected\fP are
only shown once. When you reenter the group the mark will be gone.
.IP 1
\fBKill all arts & show with K\fP will process all articles in the
group and therefore there is a processing overhead when using this
option. Killed articles are threaded as normal but they will be
marked with \fBart_marked_killed\fP.
.IP 2
\fBKill all arts and never show\fP will process all articles in the
group and therefore there is a processing overhead when using this
option. Killed articles simply does not get displayed at all.

\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/Mail\fR.
.TP
.B mailer_format
The format string used to create the mailer command with parameters that is
used for mailing articles to other people. Default is '%M "%T" < %F' (e.g.,
/bin/mail "iain" < .article). The flexible format allows other mailers with
different command line parameters to be used such as

.B mm_charset
Charset supported locally, which is also used for MIME header
(charset parameter and charset name in header encoding) in mail and
news postings. If \fBMIME_STRICT_CHARSET\fP is defined at the compile
time, text in charset other than the value of this parameter is
considered not displayable and represented as '?'. Otherwise, all
character sets are regarded as compatible with the display. If it's
not set, the value of the environment variable $\fBMM_CHARSET\fP is
used. US-ASCII or compile-time default is used in case neither of
them is defined. If your system supports
.BR \%iconv (3),
this option is disabled and you should use \fBmm_network_charset\fP instead.
.TP
.B mm_network_charset
Charset used for posting and MIME headers; replaces \fBmm_charset\fP.
Conversion between \fBmm_network_charset\fP and local charset (determined
via

A regular expression that tin will use to find the end of a verbatim block.
Default is #v-
.TP
.B verbatim_handling
If ON verbatim blocks will be detected.
Default is ON
.TP
.B wildcard
Allows you to select how
.BR \%tin (1)
matches strings. The default is 0 and uses the wildmat notation, which is
how this has traditionally been handled. Setting this to 1 allows you to use
.BR \%perl (1)
compatible regular expressions
.BR \%pcre (3).
You will probably want to update your filter
file if you use this regularly. NB: Newsgroup names will always be matched
using the wildmat notation.

displayed, even when they are highlighting marks?

.B word_highlight
Enable word highlighting. See \fBword_h_display_marks\fP for the options
available. If \fBuse_color\fP is enabled the colors specified in
\fBcol_markdash\fP, \fBcol_markslash\fP, \fBcol_markstar\fP and
\fBcol_markstroke\fP are used for word highlighting else the character
attributes specified in \fBmono_markdash\fP, \fBmono_markslash\fP,
\fBmono_markstar\fP and \fBmono_markstroke\fP are used.
.TP
.B wrap_column
Sets the column at which a displayed article body should be wrapped.
If this value is equal to 0, it defaults to the current screen width.
If this value is greater than your current screen width the part
off-screen is not displayed. Thus setting this option to a large
value can be used to disable wrapping. If this value is negative the
wrap margin is the current screen width plus the given value (as long
as the result is still positive, otherwise it will fall back to the
current screen width). Default is 0, wrapping at the current screen
width.
.TP
.B wrap_on_next_unread
If enabled a search for the next unread article will wrap around all
articles to find also previous unread articles. If disabled the search
stops at the end of the thread list. Default is ON.
