.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtin\fP is a full\-screen easy to use Usenet newsreader. It can read news
locally (e.g., \fI/var/spool/news\fP) or remotely (\fBrtin\fP or \fBtin \-r\fP option)
via a NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) server. It will automatically
utilize NOV \fBnewsoverview\fP(5)  style index files if available locally or
via the NNTP [X]OVER command (\fBRFC2980\fP, \fBRFC3977\fP).
.PP
\fBtin\fP has four separate levels of operation: Selection level, Group level,
Thread level and Article level. Use the \fBHelp\fP ('\fBh\fP')  command to view a
list of the commands available at a particular level.
.PP
On startup \fBtin\fP will show a list of the newsgroups found in
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.newsrc\fP. An arrow '\->' or highlighted bar
will point to the first newsgroup. Move to a group by using the terminal
arrow keys (terminal dependent) or \fBDown\fP ('\fBj\fP')  and \fBUp\fP ('\fBk\fP'). Use
PgUp/PgDn (terminal dependent) or \fBPageUp\fP ('\fB^U\fP') (CTRL\-U) and
\fBPageDown\fP ('\fB^D\fP')  (CTRL\-D) to page up/down. Enter a newsgroup by
pressing '\fB<CR>\fP'.
.PP
.\"
.\"
The \fBGroupNextUnreadArtOrGrp\fP ('\fB<TAB>\fP') key enters the next
newsgroup with unread articles.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP  12
\fB\-4\fP
Force connecting via IPv4 to the remote NNTP server.
.TP 
\fB\-6\fP
Force connecting via IPv6 to the remote NNTP server.
.TP 
\fB\-a\fP

.TP 
\fB\-d\fP
Don't load newsgroup descriptions (interactive mode).
.TP 
\fB\-D\fP\fI debug\-level\fP
Enter debug\-level (1 = NNTP, 2 = filter, 4 = newsrc, 8 = threading, 16 =
memory, 32 = attributes, 64 = misc).
.TP 
\fB\-f\fP\fI file\fP
Use the specified file of subscribed to newsgroups in place of
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.newsrc\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-g\fP\fI server\fP
Use the server and newsrc specified in
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/newsrctable\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-G\fP\fI article\-limit\fP
Limit the number of articles/group to retrieve from the server.
.TP 
\fB\-h\fP
Help listing all command\-line options.
.TP 
\fB\-H\fP
Brief introduction to \fBtin\fP that is also shown the first time it is
started.
.TP 
\fB\-I\fP\fI dir\fP
Directory in which to store newsgroup index files. Default is
\fI${TIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR:\-"${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin"}/.news\fP.  This option
has no effect if \fBtin\fP retrieves its index files via NNTP and
\fBcache_overview_files\fP is turned off.
.TP 
\fB\-l\fP
Get number of articles per group from the
\fI${TIN_LIBDIR:\-NEWSLIBDIR}"/"${TIN_ACTIVEFILE:\-active}\fP file. If reading
via NNTP this is done with the LIST command (\fBRFC3977\fP). This might result
in incorrect article counts but is usually faster than the default which is
to read the \fI${TIN_LIBDIR:\-NEWSLIBDIR}"/"${TIN_ACTIVEFILE:\-active}\fP file
(either directly or via LIST) and then check the article count via NNTP
GROUP command (\fBRFC3977\fP) \*(rq\fB\-ln\fP\*(rq.
.TP 
\fB\-m\fP\fI dir\fP
Mailbox directory to use. Default is \fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/Mail\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-M\fP\fI user\fP
Mail unread articles to specified user for later reading. For more
information read section "AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS".
.TP 
\fB\-n\fP
Only load groups from the
\fI${TIN_LIBDIR:\-NEWSLIBDIR}"/"${TIN_ACTIVEFILE:\-active}\fP file that are
subscribed to in the user's \fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.newsrc\fP. This allows
a noticeable speedup when connecting via a slow line, but \fBtin\fP can not
tell which groups are moderated. See also \*(rq\fB\-l\fP\*(rq.
.TP 
\fB\-N\fP
Mail unread articles to yourself for later reading. For more information
read section "AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS".
.TP 
\fB\-o\fP
Quick post all postponed articles and exit. In order for this to be really
quick, it should be used with \*(rq\fB\-n\fP\*(rq if possible.
.TP 
\fB\-p\fP\fI port\fP
Port to use if reading via NNTP (default is 119). This also overrides the
environment variable $\fBNNTPPORT\fP if set.
.TP 
\fB\-q\fP
Don't check for new newsgroups.
.TP 
\fB\-Q\fP
Quick start. Start \fBtin\fP as quickly as possible. Currently this is
equivalent to \*(rq\fB\-nqd\fP\*(rq.
.TP 
\fB\-r\fP
Read news remotely from the default NNTP server specified in the environment
variable $\fBNNTPSERVER\fP or contained in the file \fI/etc/nntpserver\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-R\fP
Read news saved by the \*(rq\fB\-S\fP\*(rq option.
.TP 
\fB\-s\fP\fI dir\fP
Save/read articles to/in directory. Default is
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/News\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-S\fP
Save unread articles for later reading by the \*(rq\fB\-R\fP\*(rq option. For more
information read section "AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS".
.TP 
\fB\-u\fP
Create/update index files for every group in
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.newsrc\fP or file specified by the \*(rq\fB\-f\fP\*(rq
option. This option is disabled if \fBtin\fP retrieves its index files via a
NNTP server and \fBcache_overview_files\fP is turned off.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fP
Verbose mode for \*(rq\fB\-c\fP\*(rq, \*(rq\fB\-M\fP\*(rq, \*(rq\fB\-N\fP\*(rq, \*(rq\fB\-S\fP\*(rq, \&\*(rq\fB\-u\fP\*(rq and
\&\*(rq\fB\-Z\fP\*(rq options.
.TP 
\fB\-V\fP
Print version and date information.
.TP 
\fB\-w\fP
Quick mode to post an article and then exit. In order for this to be really
quick, it should be used with \*(rq\fB\-n\fP\*(rq if possible.
.TP 
\fB\-x\fP
No posting mode. You cannot post articles if you use this option.
.TP 
\fB\-X\fP
No overwrite mode. \fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.newsrc\fP and files in
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin\fP will not be overwritten but may be created
if they don't exist.
.TP 
\fB\-z\fP
Only start \fBtin\fP if there is any new/unread news. If there is news \fBtin\fP
will position cursor at first group with unread news. Useful for putting in
login file.
.TP 
\fB\-Z\fP
Check if there is any new/unread news and exit with appropriate status. If
\&\*(rq\fB\-v\fP\*(rq option is specified the number of unread articles in each group
is printed. An exit code 0 indicates no news, 1 that an error occurred and 2
that new/unread news exists. Useful for writing scripts.
.PP
\fBtin\fP can also dynamically change its options by the \fBOptionMenu\fP ('\fBM\fP')
command. Any changes are written to
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc\fP. For more information see section
"GLOBAL OPTIONS MENU AND TINRC CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES" and \fBtin\fP(5).
.PP
A list of groups can be specified after the other command\-line options. This
can be useful if you wish to yank in or subscribe to a hand\-picked subset of
the active newsgroups. See the section "NEWSGROUP LISTS & WILDCARDS" for the
types of pattern that \fBtin\fP understands.
.PP
If you specify a single group\-name, or a wildcard that matches a single
group, then you will automatically enter that group. Otherwise the normal
group selection screen will appear, but with all the matching groups present
too, as though you had yanked just those groups in.
.PP
With the \*(rq\fB\-w\fP\*(rq flag a given group\-name is used as default group to post
to. If more than one group or a wildcard is specified only the first group
respectively the first group that matches is used.
.PP
Once you use \fBSelectYankActive\fP ('\fBy\fP') to yank in all active groups, or
\fBSelectToggleReadDisplay\fP ('\fBr\fP') to toggle the read/unread status, then
the command\-line groups will be gone. You can use \fBSelectSyncWithActive\fP
('\fBY\fP') to reread the
\fI${TIN_LIBDIR:\-NEWSLIBDIR}"/"${TIN_ACTIVEFILE:\-active}\fP file and get them
back.
.PP
NB: With the \*(rq\fB\-n\fP\*(rq flag, only unsubscribed groups in the
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.newsrc\fP file (or the newsrc\-file given by the
\&\*(rq\fB\-f\fP\*(rq command\-line switch or via
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/newsrctable\fP) can be matched.
.PP
.\"
.\"
Command\-line options have higher priority than attributes and tinrc
options.  Thus, command\-line option takes precedence over configured values.
.SH USAGE
.\"
.\"
.SS "NEWS ADMINISTRATION"
Maintaining Netnews on large networks of machines can be a pretty time
consuming job as I discovered when I was given the job of maintaining our
news system and news users.
.PP
.\"
.\"
A user starting \fBtin\fP for the first time can be automatically subscribed to
a list of newsgroups that are deemed appropriate by the news
administrator. The subscriptions file should be created in your news lib
directory (i.e., \fI${TIN_LIBDIR:\-NEWSLIBDIR}/subscriptions\fP) and should have
file permissions set to 0644. If you read news via NNTP, then your news
server must support the LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS command. It is part of the NNTP
List Extensions (\fBRFC6048\fP) and all modern servers should understand it.
.SS "SCREEN FORMAT"
\fBtin\fP has four separate levels of operation: Selection level, Group level,
Thread level and Article level.
.PP
At the Selection level the title displays (the name of the newsserver and)
the number of subscribed groups (containing new unread articles). The
newsgroups are displayed in the middle of the screen with the number of
unread articles displayed on the same line in front.

There may also be a character prefixing the line. An explanation follows:
.TP  10
\fBu\fP
This group is unsubscribed. To see only your subscribed groups use the
\fBSelectToggleReadDisplay\fP ('\fBr\fP') or \fBSelectYankActive\fP ('\fBy\fP') toggle
keys.
.TP 
\fBM\fP
This is a moderated group. Any posts you make will have to be approved by
the group administrator before it will be made public. \fBtin\fP will ask for
confirmation before you post to a moderated group.
.TP 
\fBN\fP
This is a new newsgroup which has been created since you last used
\fBtin\fP. New newsgroups are not subscribed to by default (However, see the
$\fBAUTOSUBSCRIBE\fP / $\fBAUTOUNSUBSCRIBE\fP environment variables).  Subscribe
to it in the normal way if you wish the group to continue to appear in your
Selection Menu. Simply ignore new newsgroups and they will be gone the next
time you start \fBtin\fP. You will have to yank in all the groups to find them
in a later session.
.TP 
\fBD\fP
This group no longer exists. If you no longer wish to see this group then
unsubscribe from it in the normal way. This flag will only appear if you
have set \fBstrip_bogus\fP to "ask" in the Options Menu.
.TP 
\fBX\fP
You may no longer make posts to this group. Often a group will be superseded
by a more appropriately named one.
.TP 
\fB=\fP
This group has been renamed and you may no longer post to it. If you do,
then you will receive an error from your newsserver telling you the correct
group to post to.
.PP
At the Group level the title contains the name of the group, the number of
conversation threads, the threading method, the limit of articles to get,
the total number of articles, the number of hot articles, the number of
recent articles and the number of killed articles. I.e.:
.PP
.nf
.\" FIXME - make this autocenter
            alt.sources (5B \-50/23+ 0* 3o 0K)
.fi
.PP
The characters after the numbers are depending to the configuration and if
your are in \fBshow_only_unread_arts\fP mode or not. Some numbers could be
missing if the specific option is not enabled. It might also contain an 'M',
\&'X' or '=' (see above; doesn't work with the \*(rq\fB\-n\fP\*(rq command\-line
switch!) if the group is moderated, set to no posting or postings to it get
redirected.
.PP
If a thread has unread articles in it it's marked with a
\fBart_marked_unread\fP in front of the total number of articles in the
thread. If there are recent articles within the thread it might be marked
with \fBart_marked_recent\fP in front of the total number of articles in the
thread \- this is controlled by the \fBrecent_time\fP option. If a thread has
hot articles in it (see also section "FILTERING ARTICLES") it's marked with
\fBart_marked_selected\fP in front of the total number of articles in the
thread. The number of lines of the first (unread) article in the thread
might also be shown right before the subject \- this is controlled by the
\fBshow_info\fP option.

.SS "GLOBAL COMMANDS"
The following commands are available at all 4 menu levels and always have
the same effect.
.PP
.TP  10
\fBShellEscape '!'\fP
Shell escape. \fBShellEscape\fP by itself will launch a shell, \fBShellEscape\fP

.SS "GLOBAL OPTIONS MENU AND TINRC CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES"
.\" FIXME - add missing descriptions
At startup, \fBtin\fP reads in the configuration files (see also \fBtin\fP(5)). 
They contain a list of variables that can be used to configure the way
\fBtin\fP works. If it exists, the global configuration file,
\fI${TIN_LIBDIR:\-NEWSLIBDIR}/tinrc\fP is read. After that, the user's own
configuration file is read from \fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc\fP. The
global file is useful for distributing system\-wide defaults to new users who
have no private tinrc yet.
.PP
The variables are user configurable by editing
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc\fP directly. Most of them can also be set
in the GLOBAL OPTIONS MENU which is accessed by pressing \fBOptionMenu\fP
('\fBM\fP') at all levels. It allows the user to customise the behaviour of
\fBtin\fP. The options are saved to the file
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc\fP when you exit \fBtin\fP so don't edit the
file directly whilst \fBtin\fP is running.
.PP
In the options menu use the cursor keys in the usual way to move around. Use
\fBConfigSelect\fP ('\fB^J\fP' or '\fB<CR>\fP') to 'open' the option you wish
to change. You will need to enter a new value or use '\fB<SPACE>\fP' to
toggle the available options. \fBConfigSelect\fP will save the new value,
\&'\fB<ESC>\fP' will abort without saving changes.
.PP
As with the other menus, \fBRedrawScr\fP ('\fB^L\fP') will redraw the screen. You
can use \fBSearchSubjF\fP ('\fB/\fP'), \fBSearchSubjB\fP ('\fB?\fP') and \fBSearchRepeat\fP
('\fB\e\fP') to search for a specific option. Use \fBQuit\fP ('\fBq\fP') to exit the
option menu and keep your changes. Use \fBQuitTin\fP ('\fBQ\fP') to exit without
keeping your changes.
.PP
The options menu provides access to the attributes menu for the current
group by the \fBConfigToggleAttrib\fP ('\fB<TAB>\fP') command. Pressing
\fBConfigToggleAttrib\fP again toggles back to the options menu. For more
information see section "ATTRIBUTES MENU AND GROUP ATTRIBUTES".
.PP
The \fBConfigScopeMenu\fP ('\fBS\fP') command brings up the scopes menu. For more
information see section "SCOPES MENU".
.PP
Here is a full list of all the available variables. The name in braces is
the name of the corresponding setting in
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc\fP.

\fBKill only unread arts\fP is the 'traditional' behaviour of \fBtin\fP. Only
unread articles are killed once only by marking them read. As filtering only

Standard (\fBRFC5322\fP and \fBRFC2047\fP). Default is OFF.
.TP 
\fBMail address (mail_address)\fP
User's mail address (and full name), if not username@host. This is used when
creating articles, sending mail and when \fBpgp\fP(1)  signing.
.TP 
\fBMIME encoding in mail messages (mail_mime_encoding)\fP

.TP 
\fBInvocation of your mail command (mailer_format)\fP
.\" TODO: document %S, %T, %M, %F, %U ...
The format string used to create the mailer command with parameters that is
used for mailing articles to other people. Default is '%M "%T" < %F'
(e.g., /bin/mail "iain" < .article). The flexible format allows other
mailers with different command\-line parameters to be used such as 'elm \-s
"%S" "%T" < "%F"' (e.g., elm \-s "subject" "iain" < .article) or
\&'sendmail \-oi \-oem \-t < %F' (e.g. sendmail \-oi \-oem \-t < .article).

non\-textual attachments. The 'V' command can always be used to manually view
any attachments.  See also \fBask_for_metamail\fP.
.TP 
\fBMM_CHARSET (mm_charset)\fP
Charset supported locally, which is also used for MIME header (charset
parameter and charset name in header encoding) in mail and news postings. If
\fBMIME_STRICT_CHARSET\fP is defined at compile time, text in charset other
than the value of this parameter is considered not displayable and
represented as '?'. Otherwise, all character sets are regarded as compatible
with the display. If it's not set, the value of the environment variable
$\fBMM_CHARSET\fP is used. US\-ASCII or compile\-time default is used in case
neither of them is defined. If your system supports \fBiconv\fP(3), this option
is disabled and you should use \fBmm_network_charset\fP instead.
.TP 
\fBMM_NETWORK_CHARSET (mm_network_charset)\fP
Charset used for posting and MIME headers; replaces \fBmm_charset\fP. 
Conversion between \fBmm_network_charset\fP and local charset (determined via
\fBnl_langinfo\fP(3))  is done via \fBiconv\fP(3), if this function is not
available on your system this option is disabled and you have to use
\fBmm_charset\fP instead. \fBmm_network_charset\fP is limited to one of the
following charsets:
.in +.3i
US\-ASCII, ISO\-8859\-{1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,13,14,15,16}, KOI8\-{R,U,RU}
EUC\-{CN,JP,KR,TW}, ISO\-2022\-{CN,CN\-EXT,JP,JP\-1,JP\-2}, Big5, UTF\-8
.in -.3i
Not all values might work on your system, see \fBiconv_open\fP(3)  for more
details. If it's not set, the value of the environment variable
$\fBMM_CHARSET\fP is used. US\-ASCII or compile\-time default is used in case
neither of them is defined.

.TP 
\fBDisplay these header fields (or *) (news_headers_to_display)\fP
Which news headers you wish to see. If you want to see _all_ the headers,
place an '*' as this value. This is the only way a wildcard can be used.  If
you enter 'X\-' as the value, you will see all headers beginning with 'X\-'
(like X\-Alan or X\-Pape). You can list more than one by delimiting with
spaces. Not defining anything turns off this option.
.TP 
\fBDo not display these header fields (news_headers_to_not_display)\fP
Same as \fBnews_headers_to_display\fP except it denotes the opposite. An
example of using both options might be if you thought X\- headers were A Good
Thing(tm), but thought Alan and Pape were miscreants... well then you would
do something like this: \fInews_headers_to_display=X\-\fP
\fInews_headers_to_not_display=X\-Alan X\-Pape\fP.  Not defining anything turns
off this option.
.TP 
\fBQuote line when following up (news_quote_format)\fP
Format of quote line when posting/following up an article (%A=Address,
%D=Date, %F=Fullname+Address, %G=Groupname, %M=Message\-ID, %N=Fullname,

article. Default is ON.
.TP 
\fBUse 8bit characters in news headers (post_8bit_header)\fP
Allows 8bit characters unencoded in the header of a news article, if set
this also disables the generation of MIME\-headers when they are usually
required. Default is OFF. Only enacted if \fBpost_mime_encoding\fP is also set
to 8bit. In a number of local hierarchies where 8bit characters are used,
using unencoded (raw)  8bit characters in header is acceptable and sometimes
even recommended so that you need to check the convention adopted in the
local hierarchy of your interest to determine what to do with this and
\fBpost_mime_encoding\fP.
.TP 
\fBMIME encoding in news messages (post_mime_encoding)\fP
MIME encoding of the body in news message, if necessary. (8bit, base64,
quoted\-printable, 7bit). Default is 8bit, which leads to no encoding. base64

.TP 
\fBQuoting behaviour (quote_style)\fP
How articles should be quoted when following up or replying to them. There
are a number of things that can be done: empty lines can be quoted,
signatures can be quoted and quote_chars can be compressed when quoting
multiple times (for example, '> > >' will be turned into
\&'>>>'). The default is to compress quotes, and to quote empty
lines.
.br
When you are viewing an article in raw mode ('\fB^H\fP'), and follow up or
reply to it, the signature will be quoted even if it would otherwise not
be.  If \fBshow_signatures\fP is off, then the signature will never be quoted.
.TP 
\fBRegex used to show quoted lines (quote_regex)\fP
A regular expression that will be applied when reading articles. All

Sets the column at which a displayed article body should be wrapped.  If
this value is equal to 0, it defaults to the current screen width.  If this
value is greater than your current screen width the part off\-screen is not
displayed. Thus setting this option to a large value can be used to disable
wrapping. If this value is negative the wrap margin is the current screen
width plus the given value (as long as the result is still positive,

.SS "ATTRIBUTES MENU AND GROUP ATTRIBUTES"
\fBtin\fP allows certain attributes to be set on a per group basis. If it
exists, the global attributes file, \fI${TIN_LIBDIR:\-NEWSLIBDIR}/attributes\fP
is read. After that, the user's own attributes file
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/attributes\fP is read.  The global attributes
file is useful for distributing system\-wide defaults to new users who have
no private attributes file yet.
.PP
Note that the \fIscope=<grouplist>\fP line has to be specified before
the attributes are specified for that list. All attributes are set to a
reasonable default so you only have to specify the attribute that you want
to change (e.g., savedir). All toggle attributes are set by specifying
ON/OFF. Otherwise, these function exactly the same as their global
equivalents. For more details see \fBtin\fP(5).
.PP
Attributes can also be changed from the attributes menu which can be
accessed by \fBConfigToggleAttrib\fP ('\fB<TAB>\fP') from the options menu
or \fBScopeSelect\fP ('\fB^J\fP' or '\fB<CR>\fP') from the scopes menu.  The
attributes menu looks and behaves very similar to the options menu. The
title shows the current scope. Attributes set in the current scope are
marked with '\+' to the left of the attributes number.
.PP
.\"
.\"
Besides the keys for moving around and changing values known from the
options menu the attributes menu provides the following command:
\fBConfigResetAttrib\fP ('\fBr\fP') which resets an attribute to a default value.
.SS "SCOPES MENU"
The scopes menu (accessible from the options menu with \fBConfigScopeMenu\fP
('\fBS\fP')) shows all scopes read from the global and local attributes file. 
Scopes from the global attributes file are marked with '!' to the left of
the scope number. Delete/rename/move are not possible with those scopes.
.PP
.\"
.\"
In addition to the common moving keys the following commands are available:
\fBScopeSelect\fP ('\fB^J\fP' or '\fB<CR>\fP') enter the attributes menu for
the current scope, \fBScopeEditAttributesFile\fP ('\fBE\fP') edit the local
attributes file, \fBScopeAdd\fP ('\fBa\fP') add a new scope, \fBScopeDelete\fP
('\fBd\fP') delete the current scope, \fBScopeMove\fP ('\fBm\fP') move the current
scope to a new position, \fBScopeRename\fP ('\fBr\fP') rename the current
scope. \fBToggleHelpDisplay\fP ('\fBH\fP') toggles the help mini menu at the
bottom of the screen.
.SS "FILTERING ARTICLES"
.\" FIXME - add scoring description
When there is a subject or an author which you are either very interested
in, or find completely uninteresting, you can easily instruct \fBtin\fP to
\fIauto\-select\fP or \fIauto\-kill\fP articles that match \fIrules\fP that you
specify. This can be anything from the name of the author to the number of
lines in an article.
.PP
When \fBtin\fP starts up the user's kill\-file
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/filter\fP (see also \fBtin\fP(5))  is read. Each
time a newsgroup is entered the rules are applied and articles killed or
selected when they meet certain criteria.
.PP
The degree to which rules are applied depend on the \fBkill_level\fP tinrc
setting. By default killed articles will only be marked read. Adjust
\fBkill_level\fP for more aggressive processing. Articles that match an
auto\-selection rule are marked with a \*(rq*\*(rq.
.PP
Filtering rules can be manually entered into
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/filter\fP (but don't do this whilst running
\fBtin\fP else you will lose your changes) or by using an on\-screen menu within
\fBtin\fP.
.PP
The filtering capabilities of \fBtin\fP have been significantly enhanced over
previous versions to include scoring and better pattern matching. It is
recommended that you read the file \fIfiltering\fP in the \fBtin\fP documentation
directory. This file can also be read online at

The on\-screen filtering menu is accessed by pressing '\fB^K\fP' at the Group
and Article levels. It allows the user to kill or select an article that
matches the current \*(rqSubject:\*(rq line, \*(rqFrom:\*(rq line or a string entered by
the user. The user entered string can be applied to the \*(rqSubject:\*(rq or
\&\*(rqFrom:\*(rq lines of an article. The kill description can be limited to the
current newsgroup or it can apply to all newsgroups. Once entered the user
can abort the command and not save the kill description, edit the kill file
or save the kill description.
.SS "POSTING ARTICLES"
\fBtin\fP allows posting of articles, follow\-up to already posted articles and
replying direct through mail to the author of an article.
.PP
Use the \fBPost\fP ('\fBw\fP') command to post an article to a newsgroup.  After
entering the post subject the default editor (i.e., \fBvi\fP(1))  or the editor
specified by the $\fBVISUAL\fP or $\fBEDITOR\fP environment variable will be
started and the article can be entered. To crosspost articles simply add a
comma and the name of the newsgroup(s) to the end of the \*(rqNewsgroups:\*(rq
line at the beginning of the article. After saving and exiting the editor
you are asked if you wish to a)bort posting the article, e)dit the article
again or p)ost the article to the specified newsgroup(s).
.PP
Use the \fBDisplayPostHist\fP ('\fBW\fP') command to display a history of the
articles you have posted. The date the article was posted, which newsgroups
the article was posted to and the articles subject line are displayed.
.PP
Use the \fBPageFollowupQuote\fP ('\fBf\fP'), \fBPageFollowup\fP ('\fBF\fP')  or
\fBPageFollowupQuoteHeaders\fP ('\fB^W\fP') command to post a follow\-up article to
an already posted article. The \fBPageFollowupQuote\fP command will copy the
text of the original article into the editor. The
\fBPageFollowupQuoteHeaders\fP command will copy the text and all headers of
the original article into the editor. The editing procedure is the same as
when posting an article with the \fBPost\fP ('\fBw\fP') command.
.PP
.\"
.\"
Use the \fBPageReplyQuote\fP ('\fBr\fP'), \fBPageReply\fP ('\fBR\fP') or
\fBPageReplyQuoteHeaders\fP ('\fB^E\fP') command to reply direct through mail to
the author of an already posted article. The \fBPageReplyQuote\fP command will
copy the text of the original article into the editor. The
\fBPageReplyQuoteHeaders\fP command will copy the text and all headers of the
original article into the editor. The editing procedure is the same as when
posting an article with the \fBPost\fP ('\fBw\fP') command. After saving and
exiting the editor you are asked if you wish to abort sending the article
via \fBPostAbort\fP ('\fBa\fP'), edit the article again via \fBPostEdit\fP ('\fBe\fP')
or send the article to the author via \fBPostSend\fP ('\fBs\fP').
.SS "CUSTOMIZING THE ARTICLE QUOTE STRING"
When posting a followup to an article or replying direct to the author of an
article via email the text of the article can be quoted. The beginning of
the quoted text can contain information about the quoted article (e.g., Name
and the Message\-ID of the article). To allow for different situations
certain information from the article can be used in the quoted string. The
following variables are expanded if found in the tinrc variables
\fBmail_quote_format\fP, \fBnews_quote_format\fP or \fBxpost_quote_format\fP:
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'%A  'u +\w'Address'u
\fB%A\fP	Address (Email)
\fB%D\fP	Date (uses \fBdate_format\fP)
\fB%F\fP	Full address (%N <%A>)
\fB%G\fP	Groupname
\fB%M\fP	Message\-ID
\fB%N\fP	Fullname of author
\fB%C\fP	Firstname of author

The quoted text section of an article is marked by a preceding quote string
at the beginning of each quoted line. The default quote string is set to
\&'>_'. The default can be changed by setting the tinrc variable
\fBquote_chars\fP to ones own preference. (Note that '_' underline is used to
represent a space).
.SS "MAILING PIPING PRINTING REPOSTING AND SAVING ARTICLES"
The command interface to \fBGroupMail\fP, \fBPageMail\fP, \fBPostMail\fP or
\fBThreadMail\fP ('\fBm\fP'), \fBPipe\fP ('\fB|\fP'), \fBPrint\fP ('\fBo\fP'), \fBPageRepost\fP
or \fBGroupRepost\fP ('\fBx\fP') and \fBGroupSave\fP, \fBPageSave\fP or \fBThreadSave\fP
('\fBs\fP' and \fBGroupAutoSave\fP, \fBPageAutoSave\fP or \fBThreadAutoSave\fP '\fBS\fP')
articles is the same for ease of use.
.PP
Auto\-saving with \fB*AutoSave\fP ('\fBS\fP') is a special case and operates only
on marked articles. They will processed without any further prompting
according to the default save parameters defined in tinrc or by any
attributes set for the current group.
.PP
Otherwise, the initial prompt will ask you to select which article, thread,
hot (auto\-selected), regex pattern, tagged articles you wish to mail, pipe
etc.
.PP
Tagged articles must have already been tagged with a \fB*Tag\fP ('\fBt\fP') 
command. All tagged articles can be untagged by a \fB*Untag\fP ('\fBU\fP')  untag
command.
.PP
If a regex pattern is selected you are asked to enter a pattern (e.g., to
match all articles subject lines containing 'net News' you enter "net
News"). Any articles that match the entered expression will be mailed, piped
etc. See also the \fBwildcard\fP tinrc variable for advanced pattern matching
options.
.PP
Various expansion characters are recognised when entering the directory and
file to save to. Environment variables (prefixed with '$') and user home
directories (prefixed by '~' or '~username') can be specified.  Environment
variables can themselves contain other special characters.
.PP
To save articles to a mailbox enter '=<mailbox name>' when asked for
the save filename. If you enter just '=' then articles will be saved to a
mailbox with the name of the current newsgroup (eg, alt.sources).  See
\fBmaildir\fP.
.PP
To save in savedir/<news.group.name>/<filename> format enter
\&'+<filename>'.  Environment variables are allowed within a filename
(e.g., \fI$SOURCES/dir/filename\fP). See \fBsavedir\fP.
.PP
.\"
.\"
When saving articles you can specify whether the saved files should be post
processed. A default process type can be set via \fBpost_process_type\fP.
.SS "AUTOMATIC MAILING AND SAVING NEW NEWS"
\fBtin\fP allows new/unread news articles to be mailed (\*(rq\fB\-M\fP\*(rq and
\&\*(rq\fB\-N\fP\*(rq option) or saved (\*(rq\fB\-S\fP\*(rq option) in batch mode for later
reading. Useful when going on holiday and you don't want to return and find
that expire has removed a whole load of unread articles. Best to run via
\fBcron\fP(1)  everyday while away, after which you will be mailed a report of
which articles were mailed/saved from which newsgroups and the total number
of articles mailed/saved. Articles are saved in a private news structure
under your <savedir> directory (default is
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/News\fP). Be careful of using this option if you
read a lot of groups because you could overflow your file system.
.PP
When using \*(rq\fB\-S\fP\*(rq together with a given directory to save to (\*(rq\fB\-s\fP\*(rq
option), the same directory must be specified when reading the articles by
\&\*(rq\fB\-R\fP\*(rq.
.PP
If you only want to save some of your groups use the \fBbatch_save\fP tinrc
variable. Set to ON or OFF in tinrc to enable/disable saving of all groups
and then use the \fBbatch_save\fP attribute to fine tune which groups you want
to have saved. For example, if you want to save most of your groups, then
set \fBbatch_save\fP to ON in tinrc and selectively turn off the ones you don't
want using attributes.

.SS RANGES
A range is simply a group of items marked using the \fBSetRange\fP (\fB'#'\fP)
key. Certain \fBtin\fP commands will operate on a range if one exists rather
than just the current item. A range is an expression of the form
<min>\-<max>, e.g. 10\-15 will highlight items 10 through 15
on the current screen. Other than absolute numeric positions, '.' can be
used in place of the current cursor position and '$' can be used to mean the
highest number available. Currently the only commands that understand ranges
are \fBGroupMarkThdRead\fP ('\fBK\fP'), \fBMarkArtUnread\fP ('\fBz\fP') and
\fBMarkThdUnread\fP ('\fBZ\fP').
.PP
.SS "NEWSGROUP LISTS & WILDCARDS"
Several places in \fBtin\fP allow you to specify a list of newsgroups. These
include command\-line groups, (un)subscribe groups, the AUTO[UN]SUBSCRIBE
mechanism. The scope= attributes file tag and the filter file group= tag
also use the same syntax. \fBtin\fP interprets this variable similarly to
\fBrn(1).\fP It contains a list of patterns, separated by commas and possibly
prefixed with exclamation points. An exclamation point negates the meaning
of a match on this pattern, and can be used to cancel certain matches. Some
examples:
.sp
\fIalt.config,news.*,!news.test\fP
.sp
Matches alt.config and everything in the 'news' hierarchy except news.test
.PP
.\"
.\"
See the explanation for the $\fBAUTOSUBSCRIBE\fP variables for further
examples.
.SS SIGNATURES
\fBtin\fP will recognise a signature in either
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.signature\fP or \fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.Sig\fP. 
If \fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.signature\fP exists, then the signature will be
pulled into the editor for mail commands only. A signature in
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.signature\fP will not be pulled into the editor for
posting commands since \fBinews\fP(1)  will append the signature itself.
.PP
A signature in \fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.Sig\fP will be pulled into the
editor for both posting and mailing commands.
.PP
The following is an example of a \fI.Sig\fP file:
.RS
.nf
\f(CWNAMES  Joe Bar <joe@example.org>
SNAIL  Musterweg 12, 99999 Notreal, Germany\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.\"
.\"
\fBtin\fP also has the capability to generate random signatures on a per
newsgroup basis if so desired. The way to accomplish this is to specify the
default signature or the group attribute sigfile as a directory. If for
example the sigfile path is \fI/usr/iain/.sigs\fP and \fI.sigs\fP is a directory
then \fBtin\fP will select a random signature from any file that is in the
directory \fI.sigs\fP (note: one signature per numbered file). A random
signature can also consist of a fixed part signature that can contain your
name, address etc. followed by the random sig. The fixed part of the random
sig is read from the file \fI$HOME/.sigfixed\fP.
.SS "TIPS AND TRICKS"
\fBtin\fP can be pretty much be navigated by using the four cursor keys.  The
left arrow key goes up a level, the right arrow key goes down a level, the
up arrow key goes up a line and the down arrow key goes down a line.
.PP
The following newsgroups provide useful information concerning news
software:
.in +.5i
.ti -\w'\(em'u
\(emnews.software.readers (info. about news user agents tin, rn, nn, slrn
etc.)
.ti -\w'\(em'u
\(emnews.software.nntp (info. about NNTP)
.ti -\w'\(em'u
\(emnews.answers (Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about many different
themes)
.PP
Many prompts within \fBtin\fP offer a default choice that the cursor is
positioned on. By pressing '\fB<CR>\fP' the default value is taken. 
Most prompts can be aborted by pressing '\fB<ESC>\fP'.
.PP
When \fBtin\fP is run in an \fBxterm\fP(1x)  it will resize itself each time the
\fBxterm\fP(1x)  is resized.
.PP
\fBtin\fP will reread the
\fI${TIN_LIBDIR:\-NEWSLIBDIR}"/"${TIN_ACTIVEFILE:\-active}\fP file at set
intervals (\fBreread_active_file_secs\fP) to show any newly arrived news.
.PP
.\"

If you find large number of new newsgroups cluttering up your screen,
pressing \fBSelectToggleReadDisplay\fP ('\fBr\fP') will make them go away.
.SS "XTERM BUTTONS"
If the environment variable \fB$TERM\fP is set to \fBxterm\fP(1x), then button
pressing can be used to select groups and articles. In this discussion, the
buttons are assumed to be assigned conventionally (i.e., Button1 is the left
button).
.PP
In general (i.e., for the group, thread and article menus),
.TP  10
Button1 (left)
enters next (lower) level if you click on an article, otherwise pages down.
.TP 
Button2 (centre)
returns to the previous (upper) level if you click on an article, otherwise
pages up.
.TP 
Button3 (right)
positions on the article line under mouse cursor, or pages down if you've
clicked outside the list of articles.
.PP
In the group selection menu, if the mouse is pointing at a group then:
.TP  10
left button
moves to and selects the group pointed at, just like \fBSelectReadGrp\fP
('\fB<CR>\fP').
.TP 
centre button
quits the program, just like \fBQuit\fP ('\fBq\fP').
.TP 
right button
moves to the group pointed at.
.PP
In the article menu, if the mouse is pointing at an article (or thread)
then:
.TP  10
left button
reads the article pointed at, just like \fBGroupReadBasenote\fP
('\fB<CR>\fP'), or the thread, just like \fBGroupListThd\fP ('\fBl\fP').
.TP 
centre button
exits the menu, catching up on the group if you have
\fBgroup_catchup_on_exit\fP set in your configuration, just like \fBQuit\fP
('\fBq\fP').
.TP 
right button
moves to the article (or thread) pointed at.
.PP
In the thread menu, if the mouse is pointing at an article then:
.TP  10
left button
reads article pointed at, just like \fBThreadReadArt\fP ('\fB<CR>\fP').
.TP 
centre button
exits the menu, catching up on the thread if you have
\fBthread_catchup_on_exit\fP set in your configuration, just like \fBQuit\fP
('\fBq\fP').
.TP 
right button
moves to the article pointed at.
.PP
.\"
.\"
In other menus and areas button pressing reverts back to usual cut and paste
of \fBxterm\fP(1x), but after one click of any button.
.SS "INDEX FILES"
If your news server supports NOV index files (see \fBnewsoverview\fP(5), most
modern installations will) and you have a fast connection to your news
server then this section can be ignored.
.PP
If your news server doesn't support NOV index files or you have a very slow
connection to your news server then \fBtin\fP can cache the index for each
newsgroup if \fBcache_overview_files\fP is set to ON.  Note that this cache can
use up large amounts of diskspace if you read a lot of groups and/or high
traffic groups.
.PP
Each user creates/updates his/her own index files that are stored in
\fI${TIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR:\-"${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin"}/.news/\fP. If you are
reading via NNTP then the news server name will be appended to keep the
indexes for different servers separate. If you are reading off the local
spool and local overview files already exist then turning on caching will
have no effect. Likewise unless you see significant delays entering a group
when reading via NNTP then turning on caching will have little or no effect.
.PP
Entering a group the first time tends to be slow because the index file must
be built from scratch. To alleviate the slowness start \fBtin\fP to create all
index files for the groups you subscribe to with \fBtin \-u \-v\fP and go for a
coffee. Subsequent readings of a group will only need to do incremental
updating of the index file and will be much faster as only new articles will
need to be cached.
.PP
As indexing might take some time you may want to run \fBtin\fP form the system
batcher \fBcron\fP(1)  with the \*(rq\fB\-u\fP\*(rq option:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\f(CW30 6 * * * /usr/local/bin/tin \-u\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
If you are low on local disk space you should consider using \fBgetart_limit\fP
to limit the size of cached indexes and also manually purge cached data for
groups you are not reading anymore with something like:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\f(CWfind ${TIN_INDEX_NEWSDIR:\-"${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin"}/.news* \e

Set the article header field \*(rqDistribution:\*(rq to the contents of the
variable instead of the system default.
.TP 
\fBISO2ASC\fP
Set the ISO to ASCII charset decoding table character to use in decoding an
article text. Values can range from 0 to 6.
.RS +.5i
.TP 
\fB0\fP
universal table for many languages
.TP 
\fB1\fP
single\-spacing universal table
.TP 
\fB2\fP
table for Danish, Dutch, German, Norwegian and Swedish
.TP 
\fB3\fP
table for Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish using the appropriate ISO
646 variant

\fB4\fP
table with RFC 1345 codes in brackets
.TP 
\fB5\fP
table for printers that allow overstriking with backspace
.RE
.TP 
\fBORGANIZATION\fP
Set the article header field \*(rqOrganization:\*(rq to the contents of the
variable instead of the system default. If reading news on an Apollo
DomainOS machine the environment variable $\fBNEWSORG\fP has to be used instead
of $\fBORGANIZATION\fP.
.TP 
\fBNEWSORG (DomainOS)\fP
DomainOS specific, same as $\fBORGANIZATION\fP on other OSs (see above).
.TP 
\fBREPLYTO\fP
Set the article header field \*(rqReply\-To:\*(rq to the return address specified
by the variable. This is useful if you wish to receive replies at a
different address.
.TP 
\fBNAME\fP
Overrides the full name given in the gecos\-files in \fI/etc/passwd\fP, see also
\fBmail_address\fP.
.TP 
\fBREALNAME\fP
Same as $\fBNAME\fP.
.TP 
\fBHOME\fP
Pathname of the user's home directory. See \fBenviron\fP(5)  for more info.
.TP 
\fBMAILER\fP
This variable has precedence over the default mailer that is used in all
mailing operations within \fBtin\fP.
.TP 
\fBMAIL\fP
Full path to the users mailbox.
.TP 
\fBVISUAL\fP
This variable has precedence over the default editor (i.e., \fBvi\fP(1))  that
is used in all editing operations within \fBtin\fP (e.g., posting, replying,
follow\-ups, ...). Evaluation order is \fI${VISUAL:\-"${EDITOR:\-vi}"}\fP. See
\fBenviron\fP(5)  for more info.
.TP 
\fBEDITOR\fP
If $\fBVISUAL\fP is unset, then this variable is looked up for a default
editor. If $\fBEDITOR\fP and $\fBVISUAL\fP are both unset, \fBtin\fP uses the systems
default editor (i.e.  \fBvi\fP(1))  on UNIX\-systems). See \fBenviron\fP(5)  for
more info.
.TP 
\fBAUTOSUBSCRIBE\fP
A new group is checked against the list of patterns; if it matches, \fBtin\fP
subscribes the user to the group without further query.  See the section
"NEWSGROUP LISTS & WILDCARDS" for an explanation of the valid syntax. For
example, setting
.sp
\fIAUTOSUBSCRIBE=comp.os.unix.*,talk.*,!talk.politics.*\fP
.sp
will automatically subscribe the user to all new groups in the comp.os.unix
hierarchy, and all talk groups other than talk.politics groups (which will
be queried for as usual). Of course this does not work if \fBtin\fP is started
with the \*(rq\fB\-X\fP\*(rq command\-line switch.
.TP 
\fBAUTOUNSUBSCRIBE\fP
Is handled like the $\fBAUTOSUBSCRIBE\fP variable, but groups matching the list
are unsubscribed from without further query. For example, setting
.sp
\fIAUTOUNSUBSCRIBE=alt.flame.*,u*,!uk.*\fP
.sp
will automatically unsubscribe the user from all new alt.flame groups and
all groups starting with u (university groups) other than UK groups (which
will be queried for as usual).
.TP 
\fBTMPDIR\fP
A pathname of a directory made available for \fBtin\fP to create temporary
files.
.TP 
\fBMAILCAPS\fP
This variable can be used to override the default path search for mailcap
files. See also \fBtin\fP(5).
.TP 
\fBNOMETAMAIL\fP
Set this variable to disable the use of \fBmetamail\fP(1)  or a replacement
(e.g. metamutt).
.TP 
\fBMM_CHARSET\fP
.TP 
\fBISPELL\fP
Set this variable to point to \fBispell\fP(1)  or a replacement and its
cmd\-line options.
.TP 
\fBPGPOPTS\fP
Define any additional options that you wish to pass to your \fBpgp\fP(1)  or
\fBgpg\fP(1)  program.
.TP 
\fBPGPPATH\fP
Override the name of the \fBpgp\fP(1)  directory in \fB$HOME\fP that holds your
keys etc..
.TP 
\fBGNUPGHOME\fP
Override the name of the \fBgpg\fP(1)  directory in \fB$HOME\fP that holds your
keys etc..
.TP 
\fBLC_CTYPE\fP
.\" TODO: document LC_CTYPEs influence on
.\"       ~/.tin/keymap.*, 8bit char display, ...
This variable determines the \fBlocale\fP(5)  category for character handling
functions. Usually it determines the character classes for pattern matching
character classification and case conversion. Currently this is not true for
\fBtin\fP (which temporary unsets \fB$LC_CTYPE\fP right before any match is done
to avoid confusion).  It's value should be of the form
\fIlanguage\fP[\fI_territory\fP][\fI.codeset\fP][\fI@modifier\fP]. See \fBenviron\fP(5) 
for more information.
.TP 
\fBLC_MESSAGES\fP
Formats of informative and diagnostic messages and interactive responses. 
It's value should be of the form
\fIlanguage\fP[\fI_territory\fP][\fI.codeset\fP][\fI@modifier\fP]. See \fBlocale\fP(5)  and
\fBenviron\fP(5)  for more information.
.TP 
\fBLC_TIME\fP
Date and time formats. It's value should be of the form
\fIlanguage\fP[\fI_territory\fP][\fI.codeset\fP][\fI@modifier\fP]. See \fBlocale\fP(5)  and
\fBenviron\fP(5)  for more information.
.TP 
\fBLC_ALL\fP
This variable overrides the value of the \fB$LANG\fP variable and any other
\fB$LC_\fP variable. It's value should be of the form
\fIlanguage\fP[\fI_territory\fP][\fI.codeset\fP]. See \fBlocale\fP(5)  and \fBenviron\fP(5) 
for more information.
.TP 
\fBLANG\fP
This variable determines the \fBlocale\fP(5)  category for any category not
specifically selected with a variable starting with \fB$LC_\fP. It's value
should be of the form \fIlanguage\fP[\fI_territory\fP][\fI.codeset\fP]. See
\fBenviron\fP(5)  for more information.
.TP 
\fBLANGUAGE\fP
This variable defines a priority list for translations. Whenever a
translation is not available in the language selected via \fB$LC_ALL\fP or
\fB$LANG\fP the next language from the list is tried. It's value should be of
the form \fIlanguage:language[:language]\fP. See \fBenviron\fP(5)  for more
information.
.TP 
\fBCOLUMNS\fP
A decimal integer > 0 used to indicate the user's preferred width in
column positions for the terminal screen or window. If this variable is
unset or null, the implementation determines the number of columns,
appropriate for the terminal or window. When \fB$COLUMNS\fP is set, any
terminal\-width information implied by \fB$TERM\fP will be overridden. Users and
portable applications should not set \fB$COLUMNS\fP unless they wish to
override the system selection and produce output unrelated to the terminal
characteristics.
.TP 
\fBLINES\fP
A decimal integer > 0 used to indicate the user's preferred number of
lines on a page or the vertical screen or window size in lines. A line in
this case is a vertical measure large enough to hold the tallest character
in the character set being displayed. If this variable is unset or null, the
implementation determines the number of lines, appropriate for the terminal
or window. When \fB$LINES\fP is set, any terminal\-height information implied by
\fB$TERM\fP will be overridden. Users and portable applications should not set
\fB$LINES\fP unless they wish to override the system selection.
.TP 
\fBTERM\fP
.\"
.\"
.\" TODO: add missing, sort useful, document in detail
The type of terminal in use. This is used when looking up termcap
sequences.  See \fBenviron\fP(5)  for more information.
.SH SIGNALS

.SH HISTORY
.\"
.\"
\fBtin\fP is based on the \fBtass\fP(1)  newsreader that was developed by Rich
Skrenta and posted to alt.sources in March 1991; its first version was
released on August 23rd 1991.  \fBtass\fP(1)  itself was heavily influenced by
notesfiles a public domain UNIX version of PLATO Notes, developed at the
University of Illinois by Ray Essick and Rob Kolstad in 1982. For a version
overview see <http://www.tin.org/history.html>.
