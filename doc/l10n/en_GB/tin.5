.br
\fI/etc/mail/mailcap\fP
.sp
.RS
\fBmailcap\fP(5)  files as defined in \fBRFC1524\fP. The Mailcap files are read by
\fBtin\fP(1)  to determine how to display non\-text messages at the local
site. Any line that starts with "#" is a comment. Blank lines are
ignored. Otherwise, each line defines a single mailcap entry for a single
content type. Long lines may be continued by ending them with a backslash
character, "\e".
.sp
Each individual mailcap entry consists of a content\-type specification, a
command to execute, and (possibly) a set of optional "flag" values.
.sp
The "type" field is simply any legal content type name. It is the string
that will be matched against the \*(rqContent\-Type:\*(rq header to decide if this
is the mailcap entry that matches the current message. Additionally, the
type field may specify a subtype or a wildcard to match all subtypes.
.sp
The "command" field is any UNIX command and is used to specify the
interpreter for the given type of message. It will be passed to the shell
via the \fBsystem\fP(3)  facility.
.sp
.\"
.\" Two special codes can appear in the viewing command for objects of type
.\" multipart (any subtype). These are "%n" and "%F". %n will be replaced by
.\" the number of parts within the multipart object. %F will be replaced by a
.\" series of arguments, two for each part, giving first the content-type and
.\" then the name of the temporary file where the decoded part has been stored.
.\"
Semicolons and backslashes within the command or any flag field must be
quoted with backslashes. If the field contains "%s", those two characters
will be replaced by the name of a file that contains the body of the
message. If it contains "%t", those two characters will be replaced by the
content\-type field, including the subtype, if any. If it contains "%{"
followed by a parameter name and a closing "}", then all those characters
will be replaced by the value of the named parameter, if any, from the
\&\*(rqContent\-Type:\*(rq header. Finally, if the field contains "\e%", those two
characters will be replaced by a single "%" character.
.sp
Besides the type and command field the following "flags" are defined:
.TP 
\fBcompose\fP
The "compose" field may be used to specify a program that can be used to
compose a new body or body part in the given format. Its intended use is to
support mail composing agents that support the composition of multiple types
of mail using external composing agents. As with the view\-command, the
semantics of program execution are operating system dependent. The result of
the composing program may be data that is not yet suitable for mail
transport \- that is, a Content\-Transfer\-Encoding may need to be applied to
the data.
.TP 
\fBcomposetyped\fP
The "composetyped" field is similar to the "compose" field, but is to be
used when the composing program needs to specify the \*(rqContent\-Type:\*(rq
header field to be applied to the composed data. The "compose" field is
simpler, and is preferred for use with existing (non\-mail\-oriented) programs
for composing data in a given format. The "composetyped" field is necessary
when the Content\-Type information must include auxiliary parameters, and the
composition program must then know enough about mail formats to produce
output that includes the mail type information.
.TP 
\fBedit\fP
The "edit" field may be used to specify a program that can be used to edit a
body or body part in the given format. In many cases, it may be identical in
content to the "compose" field, and shares the operating\-system dependent
semantics for program execution.
.TP 
\fBprint\fP
The "print" field may be used to specify a program that can be used to print
a message or body part in the given format. As with the view\-command, the
semantics of program execution are operating system dependent.
.TP 
\fBtest\fP
The "test" field may be used to test some external condition (e.g., the
machine architecture, or the window system in use) to determine whether or
not the mailcap line applies. It specifies a program to be run to test some
condition. The semantics of execution and of the value returned by the test
program are operating system dependent. If the test fails, a subsequent
mailcap entry should be sought. Multiple test fields are not permitted \-
since a test can call a program, it can already be arbitrarily complex.
.TP 
\fBneedsterminal\fP
The "needsterminal" field indicates that the view\-command must be run on an
interactive terminal. This is needed to inform window\-oriented user agents
that an interactive terminal is needed. (The decision is not left
exclusively to the view\-command because in some circumstances it may not be
possible for such programs to tell whether or not they are on interactive
terminals.) The needsterminal command should be assumed to apply to the
compose and edit commands, too, if they exist. Note that this is NOT a test
\- it is a requirement for the environment in which the program will be
executed, and should typically cause the creation of a terminal window when
not executed on either a real terminal or a terminal window.
.TP 
\fBcopiousoutput\fP
The "copiousoutput" field indicates that the output from the view\-command
will be an extended stream of output, and is to be interpreted as advice to
the UA (User Agent mail\-reading program) that the output should be either
paged or made scroll\-able. Note that it is probably a mistake if
needsterminal and copiousoutput are both specified.
.TP 
\fBdescription\fP
The "description" field simply provides a textual description, optionally
quoted, that describes the type of data, to be used optionally by mail
readers that wish to describe the data before offering to display it.
.TP 
\fBtextualnewlines\fP
The "textualnewlines" field, if set to any non\-zero value, indicates that
this type of data is line\-oriented and that, if encoded in base64, all
newlines should be converted to canonical form (CRLF) before encoding, and
will be in that form after decoding. In general, this field is needed only
if there is line\-oriented data of some type other than text/* or non\-line\-
oriented data that is a subtype of text.
.TP 
\fBx11\-bitmap\fP
The "x11\-bitmap" field names a file, in X11 bitmap (xbm) format, which
points to an appropriate icon to be used to visually denote the presence of
this kind of data.
.TP 
\fBnametemplate\fP
The "nametemplate" field gives a file name format, in which %s will be
replaced by a short unique string to give the name of the temporary file to
be passed to the viewing command. This is only expected to be relevant in
environments where filename extensions are meaningful, e.g., one could
specify that a GIF file being passed to a gif viewer should have a name
ending in ".gif" by using "nametemplate=%s.gif"
.PP
\fBtin\fP(1)  currently only respects the "test", "description", "nametemplate"
and partly the "needsterminal" flags, all other flags are internally
ignored. It also can't handle the "%F" and "%n" expansions yet.

.RS
The group attributes files may be used to override some global settings from
\fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/.tin/tinrc\fP on a per group basis. Order is
important as last match counts; this allows one to refine attributes for
narrowed scopes. Note that the \fIscope=<grouplist>\fP line has to be
specified before the attributes are specified for that list and each
attribute can only be set once per scope section. All attributes are set to
a reasonable default so you only have to specify the attribute that you want
to change. All toggle attributes are set by specifying ON/OFF. Otherwise,
they function exactly as their global equivalents. The following group
attributes are available:
.TP 
\fBscope\fP
This changes the list of groups to which the attributes that follow will be
applied. See the section NEWSGROUP LISTS & WILDCARDS in \fBtin\fP(1)  for the

.TP 
\fBmime_forward\fP
Determines whether usenet articles are forwarded as attachment or
inline. When set to OFF, the forwarded article will be included in the body
of the mail, while setting this variable to ON will cause the article to be
attached as a separate MIME part. Enabling \fBmime_forward\fP is particularly
useful for articles consisting of multiple MIME parts such as PGP/MIME
signed messages or being encoded in a different character set than your
local one. It is also useful if the receiver should be able to operate on
the entire forwarded article (i.e., view or save it without your
comments). On the other hand, if you want to forward only some parts of the
article or to insert 'inline' annotations, you might want to disable this
option.  Currently mime_forward is forced if the article to be attached is a
multipart MIME article, this may change in a future version.  Please note
that for this option to have effect, the tinrc variable
\fBinteractive_mailer\fP has to be set to 0 (which is the default).
.TP 
\fBmime_types_to_save\fP
A comma separated list of MIME major/minor Content\-Types that will be saved
when using the view/save and save/autosave features.  A single * can be used

the newsgroup description can be displayed. Default is 32.
.TP 
\fBhide_uue\fP
If set to 'No' then raw uuencoded data is displayed. If set to 'Yes' then
sections of uuencoded data will be shown with a single tag line showing the
size and filename (much the same as a MIME attachment).  If set to 'Hide
all' then any line that looks like uuencoded data will be folded into a tag
line. This is useful when uuencoded data is split across more than one
article but can also lead to false positives. This setting can also be
toggled in the article viewer.  Default is 'No'.
.TP 
\fBinews_prog\fP
Path, name and options of external \fBinews\fP(1).  If you are reading via NNTP
the default value is "\-\-internal" (use built\-in NNTP inews), else it is

available to display long subjects. Default is OFF.
.TP 
\fBinteractive_mailer\fP
If greater than 0 your mailreader will be invoked earlier for reply so you
can use more of its features (e.g. MIME, pgp, ...). 1 means include headers,
2 means don't include headers (old use_mailreader_i=ON option). 0 turns off

.TP 
\fBkill_level\fP
This option controls the processing and display of articles that are
killed. There are 3 options, default is 0 (\fBKill only unread arts\fP).
.RS +1i
.IP 0 3
\fBKill only unread arts\fP is the 'traditional' behaviour of \fBtin\fP(1).  Only
unread articles are killed once only by marking them read. As filtering only
happens on unread articles with \fBkill_level\fP set to 0, \fBart_marked_killed\fP
and \fBart_marked_read_selected\fP are only shown once. When you reenter the
group the mark will be gone.
.IP 1
\fBKill all arts & show with K\fP will process all articles in the group and
therefore there is a processing overhead when using this option. Killed
articles are threaded as normal but they will be marked with
\fBart_marked_killed\fP.
.IP 2
\fBKill all arts and never show\fP will process all articles in the group and
therefore there is a processing overhead when using this option. Killed
articles simply does not get displayed at all.
.RE
.TP 
\fBmail_8bit_header\fP

filename to save to. Default is \fI${TIN_HOMEDIR:\-"$HOME"}/Mail\fP.
.TP 
\fBmailer_format\fP
The format string used to create the mailer command with parameters that is
used for mailing articles to other people. Default is '%M "%T" < %F'

mailers with different command line parameters to be used such as
.in +.3i
.nf
sendmail \-oem \-t < %F
elm \-s "%S" "%T" < "%F"
claws\-mail \-\-compose "mailto:%T?subject=%S&insert=%F"

parameter and charset name in header encoding) in mail and news postings. If
\fBMIME_STRICT_CHARSET\fP is defined at the compile time, text in charset other
than the value of this parameter is considered not displayable and
represented as '?'. Otherwise, all character sets are regarded as compatible
with the display. If it's not set, the value of the environment variable
$\fBMM_CHARSET\fP is used. US\-ASCII or compile\-time default is used in case
neither of them is defined. If your system supports \fBiconv\fP(3), this option
is disabled and you should use \fBmm_network_charset\fP instead.
.TP 
\fBmm_network_charset\fP
Charset used for posting and MIME headers; replaces \fBmm_charset\fP. 
Conversion between \fBmm_network_charset\fP and local charset (determined via
\fBnl_langinfo\fP(3))  is done via \fBiconv\fP(3), if this function is not
available on your system this option is disabled and you have to use

\fBnews_headers_to_display\fP
Which news headers you wish to see. If you want to see _all_ the headers,
place an '*' as this value. This is the only way a wildcard can be used. If
you enter 'X\-' as the value, you will see all headers beginning with 'X\-'
(like X\-Alan or X\-Pape). You can list more than one by delimiting with
spaces. Not defining anything turns off this option.
.TP 
\fBnews_headers_to_not_display\fP
Same as \fBnews_headers_to_display\fP except it denotes the opposite. An
example of using both options might be if you thought 'X\-' headers were A
Good Thing(tm), but thought Alan and Pape were miscreants... well then you
would do something like this: \fBnews_headers_to_display=X\-\fP
\fBnews_headers_to_not_display=X\-Alan X\-Pape\fP Not defining anything turns off
this option.

this also disables the generation of MIME\-headers when they are usually
required. Default is OFF. Only enacted if \fBpost_mime_encoding\fP is also set
to 8bit. In a number of local hierarchies where 8bit characters are used,
using unencoded (raw)  8bit characters in header is acceptable and sometimes
even recommended so that you need to check the convention adopted in the
local hierarchy of your interest to determine what to do with this and

\fBunderscores_regex\fP
A regular expression that will be applied when reading articles. All
matching words are shown in \fBcol_markdash\fP or \fBmono_markdash\fP. If
\fBundescores_regex\fP is blank, then \fBtin\fP(1)  uses a built\-in default.
.TP

ON.
.TP 
\fBurl_handler\fP

\fBuse_slrnface\fP
If enabled \fBslrnface\fP(1)  will be used to interpret the \*(rqX\-Face:\*(rq
header. For this option to have any effect, \fBtin\fP(1)  must be running in an
\fBxterm\fP(1x)  and \fBslrnface\fP(1)  must be in your $\fBPATH\fP. Default is OFF.
.TP

.TP 
\fBwildcard\fP
Allows you to select how \fBtin\fP(1)  matches strings. The default is 0 and
uses the wildmat notation, which is how this has traditionally been
handled. Setting this to 1 allows you to use \fBperl\fP(1)  compatible regular
expressions \fBpcre\fP(3).  You will probably want to update your filter file
if you use this regularly. NB: Newsgroup names will always be matched using
the wildmat notation.

Enable word highlighting. See \fBword_h_display_marks\fP for the options
available. If \fBuse_color\fP is enabled the colours specified in
\fBcol_markdash\fP, \fBcol_markslash\fP, \fBcol_markstar\fP and \fBcol_markstroke\fP are
used for word highlighting else the character attributes specified in
\fBmono_markdash\fP, \fBmono_markslash\fP, \fBmono_markstar\fP and \fBmono_markstroke\fP
are used.
.TP 
\fBwrap_column\fP
Sets the column at which a displayed article body should be wrapped.  If
this value is equal to 0, it defaults to the current screen width.  If this
value is greater than your current screen width the part off\-screen is not
displayed. Thus setting this option to a large value can be used to disable
wrapping. If this value is negative the wrap margin is the current screen
width plus the given value (as long as the result is still positive,
otherwise it will fall back to the current screen width). Default is 0,
wrapping at the current screen width.
.TP 
\fBwrap_on_next_unread\fP
If enabled a search for the next unread article will wrap around all
articles to find also previous unread articles. If disabled the search stops
