short descriptions of files in the tools-directory

tinews.pl
        a perl script that can be used as a inews replacement if posting via
        NNTP. the main purpose of this script is to automatically sign
        posted/mailed articles via pgp or gpg. besides the autosigning
        feature it takes care about Cc: and Bcc: lines in news-postings
        and adds a Posted-And-Mailed: header if necessary.

w2r.pl
	is a small perl script that turns a wildmat filter file
	into a regexp filter file (don't forget to set wildmat= in tinrc
	accordingly)
	usage:
	w2r.pl < wildmat-filter-file > regexp-filter-file

opt-case.pl
	is a small perl script that tries to opt out case insensitive
	regexp, it will put a comment above each line it touched.
	usage:
	opt-case.pl < regexp-filter-file > regexp-filter-file-case

	w2r.pl and opt-case.pl might be used together, i.e:
	w2r.pl < wildmat-filter-file | opt-case.pl > regexp-filter-file-case

tinlock
	is a small shell script that creates a lockfile before starting
	tin to avoid multiple copies of tin running, when tin exits cleanly
	the lockfile is removed; tinlock will warn about suspicious
	locks/deadlocks. tinlock is kind of NFS safe.
	usage:
	tinlock [tin-cmdline-args]

metamutt
	is a small shell script to replace metamail, set
	metamail_prog=metamutt in tin and till will pass multipart
	MIME-articles to metamutt instead of metamail. metamutt will pass
	the article to mutt (a mail client with an excellent MIME-parser).
	this might become obsolete as tin now has a small (and unfinished)
	built in MIME-parser, set metamail_prog=--internal to use the built
	in version.

url_handler.sh
	is a shell script (need to be placed in $PATH) which passes the URL
	selected by the 'U' command to a related viewer/application. this
	one is very basic.

url_handler.pl
	is a perl script (need to be placed in $PATH) which passes the URL
	selected by the 'U' command to a related viewer/application. the
	perl version has full $BROWSER support.

expand_aliases.tgz
	is a small c-source which reads you elm-aliasfile, translates the
	alias into the real address and passes it to the MTA. see included
	README-file/man-page for more details.

expiretover
	is a small shell script to expire old tin overview files. if you use
	cache_overview_files=ON in your tinrc you might want to run this
	script regularly (e.g. once a day from cron) to purge old overview
	files.
