Filtering in tin

0. Status

This is an overview of the new filtering capabilities of tin. This
document will be absorbed in the main documentation at some point.


1. Introduction

Tin's filtering mechanism has changed significantly since version 1.3beta.
Originally there were only two possibilities:

1) kill an article matching a rule.
2) hot-select an article matching a rule.

This led to constant confusion, as it seemed important which rule
came first in the filter file, but it wasn't. Then if an article was
selected for whatever reason it couldn't be killed even if it was Craig
Shergold telling you how to make money fast in a crosspost to alt.test.
This binary concept isn't modern anyway, so a much more up-to-date fuzzy
mechanism was necessary: scoring.

When using tin's new scoring mechanism you assign a "score" to each
filter rule. The scores of rules matching the current article are added
and the final score of the article decides if it is regular, marked hot
or killed.

The standard "kill" and standard "select" already in your filter-file have
the score "score_kill" and "score_select" respectively (See section 4).


2. Changes to the filter-file format

Tin understands the additional "score" command in the filter-file now.

Old style rule:

scope=*
type=0
case=0
subj=*$$$*

New style rule:

group=*
case=0
score=-100
subj=*$$$*
#####

So you can give the individual rule a weight, based on your opinion
about the rule. e.g. if you want to be sure to never read a certain
individual again, you may give the rule a score of (-)9000.

If you want only "classical" filtering and don't want to mess around
with score values, you can use the magic words "kill" and "hot" as score
values in your filter file. Example:

group=*
case=0
score=kill
subj=*$$$*
#####

These are handled as default values at program initialization time and
may be somewhat easier to remember.

You might have noticed by the examples above that tin inserts a line of
hashes between two rules now. This is *not* required, it just improves
readability.


3. Changes in the filter menu

The on screen filter menu is now more compact and fits easily on small
terminals such as a small xterm or a 640x200 CON: window now. It has been
enhanced to allow you to enter a score for the rule you are adding. It
should be in the range from 1 to SCORE_MAX otherwise it will default to
"score_select" for select filter rules and "score_kill" for kill filter
rules (See section 4).


4. Internal defaults and config options

There are some constants defined in tin.h and tinrc:

SCORE_MAX is the maximum score an article can reach. Any value
above this is cut to SCORE_MAX, the same goes for negative scores.
recommended: 10000

"score_kill" is the default score given for any kill rule, if no other
is specified.
recommended: -100

"score_select" is the default score for any auto-selection rule, if no
other is specified.
recommended: 100

"score_limit_kill" and "score_limit_select" are the limits that must be
crossed to mark an article as killed or selected.
recommended when used with values given above: -50/+50.

"score_kill", "score_select", "score_limit_kill" "score_limit_select" are
config options. You can find them in tin's configuration file
(~/.tin/tinrc). They can also be changed at runtime in the config menu.


5. Overview of "filter"-commands

Everything here is also described in the file ~/.tin/filter, albeit more
concisely.

All lines are of the form:
command=value

Valid "command"s are:

add a comment to the following rule:

comment= a short text

multiple comment lines may be used, comments lines _must_ be right before
the scope selection.

scope selection:

group=newsgroup_pattern_list

newsgroup_pattern_list is a comma-separated list of newsgroup_patterns

newsgroup_patterns can be a pattern (wildmat-style) or !pattern,
negating the match of pattern. This is the same format used for the
AUTO(UN)SUBSCRIBE environment variable.

Tin doesn't rework your filter file, the new pattern matching is only
used when you enter new entries by hand.

additional info:

case=num    num: 0=casesensitive, 1=caseinsensitive
score=num   num: score value of rule, can now also be one of the magic words
                 "kill" or "hot", which are equivalent to
                 SCORE_KILL and SCORE_SELECT respectively.
time=num    num: time_t value; when rule expires. When tin writes the filter
                 file it adds the time in human readable form as a comment in
                 parentheses after the numeric value. When reading the file
                 tin uses _only_ the numeric value, not the human readable form.

matches:            matched to:

subj=pattern        Subject:
from=pattern        From:
                    Tin converts the contents of the From-header to an
                    old-style e-mail address, i.e. ''some@body.example (John
                    Doe)'' instead of ''John Doe <some@body.example>'',
                    before trying to match the patterns in the filter rule.
                    That way a rule tailored to match the full from
                    header "jsmith@ac.example (John Smith)" will still work
                    when John posts with a different newsreader which uses
                    "John Smith <jsmith@ac.example>".
msgid=pattern       Message-Id: *AND* full References:
msgid_last=pattern  Message-Id: and last Reference:s entry only
msgid_only=pattern  Message-Id:
refs_only=pattern   References: line (e.g. <123@ether.net>) without Message-Id:
lines=num           Lines: ; <num matches less than, >num matches more than.
gnksa=[<>]?NUM      GNKSA parse_from() return code
xref=pattern        Xref: ; filter crossposts to groups matching pattern

When you are using wildmat pattern-matching, patterns in ~/.tin/filter
should be delimited with "*", verbatim wildcards in patterns must be
escaped with "\". When using the built-in filter-file functions, tin tries
to take care of it for itself, except when you are entering text in the
built in kill/hot-menu. Then you have to quote manually because tin
doesn't know if e.g. "\[" is already quoted or not.

GNKSA return codes: these are the return codes of the From:-address
parser, enabling you to filter on certain kinds of syntactical and
semantical errors present in that header. For an up-to-date list see the
definitions in extern.h and the parser source code in misc.c, the
following is just a short introduction.

6. EXAMPLES

6.1 WILDMAT EXAMPLES

none given, too simple, find out yourself ,-)

6.2 REGEXP EXAMPLES

Be sure to change Wildcard setting from WILDMAT (default) to REGEX to make
the following examples to work properly. This can be done using the internal
configuration menu or in file ~/.tin/tinrc

7. TODO

- make the time value in the filter file more human readable.
- rewrite filtering order to get optimal performance
- filtering on arbitrary header lines
- move docu to tin.5
