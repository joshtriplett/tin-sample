.TH NEWSOVERVIEW 5 local "redistributable"
.DA 21 October 1992
.SH NAME
newsoverview \- netnews overview files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI /usr/spool/news/ group /.overview
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each newsgroup directory contains a file named
.RB ` .overview ',
containing one-line summaries of articles in that group.
Fields are separated by tabs,
and any tabs or newlines in the original articles headers
have been replaced with spaces.
The fields are,
in order:
article number (file name),
subject,
author,
date,
message-id,
references,
byte count,
line count,
and
optionally other headers,
as arranged locally
(none are supplied by the database maintenance software,
as shipped).
The line-count and references field may be empty.
If the optional other headers are present,
they include their header keyword and colon;
if they are absent entirely,
the tab after the line-count field may also be absent.
.PP
The file is maintained in numerical order,
by article number.
.PP
At the time of writing
(late 1992),
the lines in an overview file are typically 150\-300 characters long,
and an overview file for a typically busy group
is often 30,000 bytes to 60,000 bytes long,
with notable exceptions exceeding 500,000 bytes.
.SH EXAMPLES
.\" .ds Tb \ \(==\ 
.ds Tb \(bv
A few lines from one overview file,
with tabs displayed as `\*(Tb' and lines continued after `\e'.

.SH BUGS
The contents of
the line-count field
should not be believed
and are really pretty worthless yet popular.
