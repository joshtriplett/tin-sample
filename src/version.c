 * line     is the entire line we should check
 * skip     must be the leading portion of the version line not including the

 * version  is the version number (dotted triple) we expect to match
 *
 * returns RC_IGNORE     1st args dotted triple matches 3rd arg
 *         RC_UPGRADE    1st args dotted triple is older than 3rd arg
 *         RC_DOWNGRADE  1st args dotted triple is newer than 3rd arg
 *         RC_ERROR      3rd arg is not a dotted triple (usage error)

 * Don't make the arguments to sscanf() consts, as some old systems require
 * them to writable (but do not change them)
