/*
 * The following macros are used to simplify and speed up the
 * manipulation of the bitmaps in memory which record which articles
 * are read or unread in each news group.
 *
 * Data representation:
 *
 * Each bitmap is handled as an array of bytes; the least-significant
 * bit of the 0th byte is the 0th bit; the most significant bit of
 * the 0th byte is the 7th bit. Thus, the most-significant bit of the
 * 128th byte is the 1023rd bit, and in general the mth bit of the nth
 * byte is considered to be bit (n*8)+m of the map as a whole.	Conversely,
 * the position of bit q in the map is the bit (q & 7) of byte (q >> 3).
 * A bitmap of b bits will be allocated as ((b+7) >> 3) bytes.
 *
 * The routines could be changed to operate on a word-oriented bitmap by
 * changing the constants used from 8 to 16, 3 to 4, 7 to 15, etc. and
 * changing the allocate/deallocate routines.
 *
 * In the newsrc context, a 0 bit represents an article which is read
 * or expired; a 1 represents an unread article. The 0th bit corresponds
 * to the minimum article number for this group, and (max-min+7)/8 bytes
 * are allocated to the bitmap.
 *
 * Constants:
 *
 * NBITS   = total number of bits per byte;
 * NMAXBIT = number of bits per byte or word;
 * NBITPOS = number of bit in NMAXBIT;
 * NBITSON = byte/word used to set all bits in byte/word to 1;
 * NBITNEG1 = binary negation of 1, used in constructing masks.
 *
 * Macro naming and use:
 *
 * The NOFFSET and NBITIDX macro construct the byte and bit indexes in
 * the map, given a bit number.
 *
 * The NSET0 macro sets a bit to binary 0
 * The NSET1 macro sets a bit to binary 1
 * The NSETBLK0 macro sets the same bit or bits to binary 0
 * The NSETBLK1 macro sets the same bit or bits to binary 1
 * The NTEST macro tests a single bit.
 * These are used frequently to access the group bitmap.
 *
 * NSETBLK0 and NSETBLK1 operate on whole numbers of bytes, and are
 * mainly useful for initializing complete bitmaps to one state or
 * another. Both use the memset function, which is assumed to be
 * optimized for the target architecture. NSETBLK is currently used to
 * initialize the group bitmap to 1s (unread).
 *
 * NSETRNG0 and NSETRNG1 operate on ranges of bits, from a low bit number
 * to a high bit number (inclusive), and are especially useful for
 * efficiently setting a contiguous range of bits to one state or another.
 * NSETRNG0 is currently used on the group bitmap to mark the ranges the
 * newsrc file says are read or expired.
 *
 * The algorithm is this. If the high number is less than the low, then
 * do nothing (error); if both fall within the same byte, construct a
 * single mask expressing the range and AND or OR it into the byte; else:
 * construct a mask for the byte containing the low bit, AND or OR it in;
 * use memset to fill in the intervening bytes efficiently; then construct
 * a mask for the byte containing the high bit, and AND or OR this mask
 * in. Masks are constructed by left-shift of 0xff (to set high-order bits
 * to 1), negating a left-shift of 0xfe (to set low-order bits to 1), and
 * the various negations and combinations of the same. This procedure is
 * complex, but 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than a shift inside a
 * loop for each bit inside a loop for each individual byte.
