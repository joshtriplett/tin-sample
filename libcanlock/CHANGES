VERSION 2a:

11 Aug 2003
        - Only very minor changes.  The makefile was tweaked slightly
          for increased portability, and a typo in lock_strip was fixed.

VERSION 2:

10 Aug 2003
        - Replaced the SHA-1 library with the source code from RFC 1374.
          The old code had problems on PowerPC that I was too lazy to hunt
          down and fix.
        - Replaced the ISC version of Base64 with an implementation
          produced by Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The
          old functions carried a weird patent disclaimer from IBM, while
          the new ones use a nice simple non-scary BSD license.
        - The md5_key(), md5_lock() and md5_verify() functions have been
          removed.  As far as I can tell they weren't being used.
        - Added a Makefile instead of the Build thingy.
        - Did a bunch of cleanup to get rid of various warnings.

VERSION 1:

24 Sep 1998
        - Now trying to be compatible with an updated cancel lock draft.
        - We now generate the lock by hashing the Base64 encoding of the
          cancel key, instead of the underlying binary digest.
        - the xxx_key() and xxx_lock() functions now add the md5: or sha1:
          tag to the lock.
        - lock_strip_alpha() now discards pesky clue strings and normalizes
          the case of type codes.
        - the old lock_strip() that returned numeric codes will be going
          away.

VERSION 0:

21 Sep 1998
        - Endianness is now automatically figured out by build.

19 Sep 1998
        - Added MD5 hashes.
        - We now accommodate the possibility that strings will be identified
          by name instead of number, those darned drafts will get you every
          time.
        - Make changes to the hmac stuff to account for GCC weirdness; some
          check values were not coming out correctly, but they are now.

15 Sep 1998
        - Initial, just SHA-1.
