libcanlock - a library for creating and verifying cancel locks.


Copyright stuff:

    sha1.c is basically the sample code from RFC 3174 from Donald
    Eastlake and Paul Jones, and carries a BSD-ish license from the
    Internet Society.

    base64.c carries a BSD license from KTH.

    hmac_sha1.c, canlock.c, hmactest.c and canlocktest.c were written by
    Greg Andruk, and carry an MIT style license.


How to compile it:

    If you are lucky, it will be enough to unpack the archive, change to
    it top directory and run make.
        
    You can also:

        make test
            to insure the library works as Fluffy intended
        
        make clean
                to get rid of stray build gunk
            
        make nuke
                to return the directory to its lovely pristine condition
           
    The libcanlock.a that will be produced is what you want to link into
    your newsreader or whatever.


Random blabbage:

    This version compiled and ran correctly on x86, PowerPC, Itanium,
    PA-RISC and Alpha, so hopefully it's now reasonably portable.

    The canlocktest source code should give you a pretty good idea of
    how the functions work.  See the doc directory for relevant RFCs and
    stuff.

Meow.
