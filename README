Note that tin requires a valid fully qualified domain name for the host
you are running tin on. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HOST NAME WITH A VALID DOMAIN
GO AND GET ONE AND CONFIGURE YOUR HOST -- NOW! (This will prevent problems
with other software, too.) Otherwise users may get "Invalid Sender" error
messages and won't be able to post using the internal inews.
